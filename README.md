Simple Neural Network coupled with a Genetic Algorithm

Each folder in this repositorty contains a different project. Below is a quick description

Recognising Squares:
A project that tries to teach the computer to recognise 6x6 (pixel) images and determine whether they are squares or not

Movie Prediction:
This project attempts to teach the computer what sort of movies I like to watch. Once trained, in theory it will predict if I like a particular new movie or not. Then after watching it, I can use that data to further train it.
